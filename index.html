    <h1>Breakout Game!</h1>
    <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>The game begins with 1 row of bricks.
            Using a single ball, you must knock down all the bricks by using the walls 
            and/or the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them in order to go to the next level.
            Level 2 has 2 rows of bricks and level 3 has 3 rows of bricks. 
            If your paddle misses the ball's rebound, you will lose a life.
            You have three lives to try to clear all the bricks.</p>
